### Historical background

This mod refers to the siege of Caffa in the 14th century, where the Mongols, whose army decimated by the Black Death during the siege of Caffa, decided to send plague-ridden corpses by trebuchet above the city walls. Which caused the inhabitants of the city to flee the city to avoid the disease. This event is considered to be the trigger for the second plague epidemic in Europe.

### Purpose of the mod

This mod offers players to join forces or take advantage of your opponent's weakness, to fight against the bacteria and possibly against your enemies as well as survive as many waves as possible.

Victims of the Black Plague, a number of villagers that increments with each wave, become infected in a player's randomly selected base. If you fail to fight the disease, then it will spread enough to destroy your cities and kill your people. The infected have modified attributes. More precisely increased walking speed and increased health point... Perhaps more in the future ? Bacteria mutate quickly! So be reactive and above all, take up arms!
